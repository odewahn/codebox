== Color Filters
Color filters allow you to alter an image by ... well ... filtering out different colors.  While Processing has some filters built-in, it's often handy to be able to create your own custom filters.  For example, this page onhttp://3dtv.at/Knowhow/AnaglyphComparison_en.aspx [Anaglyph Methods Comparison], details a number of different filters that are handy in creating http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1463-create-3d-photographs-with-processing [stereoscopic images].  This codebox shows you how to create your own filters like these.

Filters are expressed as http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1522-multiply-matrices-in-processing/ [matrix multiplication] operations that are applied to the red, green, and blue components of the pixels in the original image.  So, basically, to create a filter, we need to pull each pixel in the original image, apply the matrix operation to its color components, and then use this new value in the corresponding pixel in the new image.  Pretty straightforward.

=== Multiplying Matrices in Processing
First, a bit of review.  A http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) [matrix] is a 2 dimensional array of numbers called elements.  Matrices are used in many different applications, representing sets of equations, transformations to 3D objects, and color filters (as in this example).  

A matrix is usually characterized by its dimensions: the number of elements in its rows (the numbers going across ) and columns (the numbers going up and down).  By convention, the number of rows always comes first. The following figure shows a 2 row by 3 matrix, which is generally just called a 2x3 matrix, and a 3x2 matrix:

To multiply two matrices together (lets call them A and B), the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B.  This is critical -- if this isn't true, then the multiplication is not defined.  (This is sort of like dividing by zero -- it's simply impossible.)  

Assuming this criteria is met, the product of the two matrices (lets call it C) will have the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B. The elements in C are equal to the sum of the products of the corresponding column element in A times the row element in B.  This is a bit tricky, but the following figure should (hopefully!) make this a bit clearer:

The following sketch illustrates how to do the operation:

So, with the basic math out of the way, we're ready to write the filter code.  The only remaining wrinkle is that images in Processing are held in one dimensional arrays of colors, rather than 2 dimensional arrays of (x,y) coordinates, as explained in this great http://processing.org/learning/pixels/[Images and Pixels] tutorial by Daniel Shiffman.  In the tutorial, he gives a nice formula that you can use to map an (x,y) coordinate to the position in the image array:

----
position in array = x + IMAGE_WIDTH * y
----

The following figure should help illustrate most of the concepts at work here:

Without further ado, here's the code to implement the filter:
